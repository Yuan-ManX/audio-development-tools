# Audio-Processing-Tools-List (APTL)

This is a list of sound, audio processing tools which contains machine learning, audio signal processing, sound synthesis, spatial audio, music information retrieval, music generation, speech recognition, speech synthesis and more.

## Machine Learning (ML)

* [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)  Librosa is a python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.
* [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)  IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most of using Python interactively.
* [torchaudio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio)  an audio library for PyTorch. Data manipulation and transformation for audio signal processing, powered by PyTorch.

## Audio Signal Processing (ASP)

* [SoundFile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  SoundFile is an audio library based on libsndfile, CFFI and NumPy.
* [Audio DSPy](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/audio_dspy)  audio_dspy is a Python package for audio signal processing tools.
* [pyAudioDspTools](https://pyaudiodsptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)  pyAudioDspTools is a python 3 package for manipulating audio by just using numpy.
* [wave](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html)  The wave module provides a convenient interface to the WAV sound format. It does not support compression/decompression, but it does support mono/stereo.
* [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)  PyAudio provides [Python](http://www.python.org/) bindings for [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) v19, the cross-platform audio I/O library. With PyAudio, you can easily use Python to play and record audio on a variety of platforms, such as GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple macOS.
* [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/)  PortAudio is a free, cross-platform, [open-source](http://www.portaudio.com/license.html), audio I/O library.  It lets you write simple audio programs in 'C' or C++ that will compile and run on many platforms including Windows, Macintosh OS X, and Unix (OSS/ALSA). It is intended to promote the exchange of audio software between developers on different platforms. Many [applications](http://www.portaudio.com/apps.html) use PortAudio for Audio I/O.
* [sounddevice](https://pypi.org/project/sounddevice/)  This [Python](https://www.python.org/) module provides bindings for the [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/) library and a few convenience functions to play and record [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays containing audio signals.
* [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)  Manipulate audio with a simple and easy high level interface.

## Sound Synthesis (SS)

* [pyo-tools](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo-tools)  Repository of ready-to-use python classes for building audio effects and synths with pyo.

## Spatial Audio (SA)

* [spaudiopy](https://spaudiopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  Spatial Audio Python Package. The focus (so far) is on spatial audio encoders and decoders. The package includes e.g. spherical harmonics processing and (binaural renderings of) loudspeaker decoders, such as VBAP and AllRAD.

## Music Information Retrieval (MIR)

## Music Generation (MG)

* [isobar](https://github.com/ideoforms/isobar)  isobar is a Python library for creating and manipulating musical patterns, designed for use in algorithmic composition, generative music and sonification. It makes it quick and easy to express complex musical ideas, and can send and receive events from various different sources including MIDI, MIDI files, and OSC.
* [MusPy](https://salu133445.github.io/muspy/)  MusPy is an open source Python library for symbolic music generation. It provides essential tools for developing a music generation system, including dataset management, data I/O, data preprocessing and model evaluation.
* [music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/)  music21 is a Toolkit for Computational Musicology.
